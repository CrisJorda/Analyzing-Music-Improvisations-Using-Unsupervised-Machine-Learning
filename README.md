This project applied unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyse musical improvisation in order to uncover fundamental principles of creative cognition.
This GitHub contains the code used to pre-train the model (pianoroll_vae_images.ipynb) and the code used to fine-tune it (data_fine_tuning.ipynb), both adapted to the 2-bar or 4-bar datasets. It also contains the code used to compute the distances between samples for the 2-bar dataset (2bar_compute_dist_dim2.ipynb), using 2 dimensions or 40 dimensions.
